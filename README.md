## Abstract: 
This project presents a machine learning approach to predicting stock prices based on historical data. A combination of technical and economic indicators are used to train a range of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and LSTM Networks. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Determination. The results show that the LSTM Network model outperforms the other models in predicting stock prices. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in stock price prediction and provides a framework for further research and development.

Keywords: Stock price prediction, Machine learning, Technical indicators, Economic indicators, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, LSTM Networks
